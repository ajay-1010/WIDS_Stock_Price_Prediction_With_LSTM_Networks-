# WEEK 2
Now that we have made ouselves comfortable with python coding and Numpy it is time to start our jounrey on Neural Networks. You can start by following the below resources for the same. During this week you will become acquainted with Artificial Neural Networks, which have proven to be highly effective in solving complex problems of different domains. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are versatile machine learning models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into layers that process input data to produce output. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a specialized type of ANN, excel at temporial data handaling, making them particularly effective for sequential or time-dependent tasks.we will provide resources for RNNs and LSTM and in next week.
