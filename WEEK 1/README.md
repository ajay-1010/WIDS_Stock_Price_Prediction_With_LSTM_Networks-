# WEEK 1
Week one of this project will begin with familiarizing ourselves with Python coding, and relevant libraries, and attaining a reasonable proficiency in this language. Given that many of you have some coding background, not necessarily in Python but in other languages, this task should be easy yet essential for us to advance. Hence, we have uploaded YouTube links and resources to the GitHub repository below. Please take a look at Section 1 to find these links.
# SECTION 1
We'll begin by mastering Python. Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab provide an interactive platform for coding, data visualization, and documentation, making them ideal environments for Python. Check out the installation procedure in the linked playlist.

Try to complete the above in 2-3 days to get a good grasp of this language.

# SECTION 2

There is no need of memorizing all the libraries function. However, it is necessary to have a basic idea. This will help you mainly in the assignments. Keep referring to these whenever needed.

# Numpy

NumPy is a crucial Python library for scientific computing, featuring multi-dimensional array support, matrices, and a suite of mathematical functions. Widely employed in machine learning, data analysis, and scientific research. Usually used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. Watch the following tutorial for a good understanding.
