# WEEK 1
Week one of this project will begin with familiarizing ourselves with Python coding, relevant libraries, and attaining a reasonable proficiency in this language.

Hence, we have uploaded YouTube links and resources to the GitHub repository below. Kindly refer to Section 1 to find these link.
