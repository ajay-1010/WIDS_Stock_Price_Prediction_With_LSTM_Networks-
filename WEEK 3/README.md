# Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs) : Advancing Sequential Data Processing
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have transformed how we handle sequential data, such as time series, natural language, and audio. By leveraging information from earlier steps in a sequence, RNNs excel in tasks where context is crucial. Their foundational design has made them indispensable for sequence modelling in numerous applications.
However, RNNs face a significant challenge: they struggle with retaining long-term dependencies. As sequences grow longer, earlier information diminishes in importance, leading to performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring comprehensive context. This limitation, often due to the vanishing gradient problem, restricts their effectiveness in many complex scenarios.
