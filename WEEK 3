# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) : The pioneers of Sequential Understanding
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have transformed how we handle sequential data, such as time series, natural language, and audio. By leveraging information from earlier steps in a sequence, RNNs excel in tasks where context is crucial. Their foundational design has made them indispensable for sequence modeling in numerous applications.
